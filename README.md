# Tweaks And Fixes for 1.7.0.0
A collection of tweaks, fixes, and moddability support features for Ultimate Admiral: Dreadnoughts.

## New Management
[NathanKell](https://github.com/NathanKell) wrote the foundation for TAF that I am extending from. They stopped development in early 2025 and are unlikely to return. I will take over the project for the forseeable future.

## Focus/Bugs/Feedback/Suggesstions/Help
My development will be focused around Brother Munro's [Dreadnought Improvement Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/ultimateadmiraldreadnoughts/mods/7?tab=description), though TAF will still be usable as a standalone mod. If you encounter any bugs while using TAF, please report them in as much detail as possible.

If you have feedback/suggestions, join the [Brother Munro Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZSAEVZ9Q) and post in #taf-feature-suggestions. If you encounter installation issues, feel free to ask in the #tweaks-and-fixes channel.

## [We Have a Wiki](https://github.com/DukeDagor/UADRealismDIP/wiki)!
Follow the link or go to the Wiki tab of this repository for all the information that was originally in the README and more! Though it's a heavy work in progress, the Wiki will be extended to include info on all aspects of UAD modding. Contact me in the discord server if you wish to contribute!

## UAD Realism
I have no plans for UAD Realism, as extending TAF will be more than enough work for me to handle.

## Installation
* [Download MelonLoader 0.6.6](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/download/v0.6.6/MelonLoader.x64.zip) and unzip it to your UAD folder.
* Download the latest [TweaksAndFixes release](https://github.com/DukeDagor/UADRealismDIP/releases/latest) and unzip it to your UAD folder. Overwrite all old files, if upgrading. If you did it right, then the path to `tweaksAndFixes.dll` should be `Ultimate Admiral Dreadnoughts\Mods\tweaksAndFixes.dll`.
* Run the game. The first launch will be slower but subsequent launches will be normal.

## Nightly
Go to the [TweaksAndFixes/TAF_Nightly](https://github.com/DukeDagor/UADRealismDIP/tree/main/TweaksAndFixes/TAF_Nightly) folder for the nightly/beta releases of TAF. These are unstable versions may have game-breaking bugs. ***Do not report bugs found in nightly versions in the GitHub issue tracker***. All nightly bug reports need to be made through the discord server.

## Default Files
* Default TAF csv files can be found in the latest [TweaksAndFixes release](https://github.com/DukeDagor/UADRealismDIP/releases/latest) for all versions after `3.20.0`. See the [mod file page](https://github.com/DukeDagor/UADRealismDIP/wiki/Mod-Files) of the Wiki for more info.
* See [here](https://github.com/DukeDagor/UADRealismDIP/wiki/Resources) for info on the default game assets.
