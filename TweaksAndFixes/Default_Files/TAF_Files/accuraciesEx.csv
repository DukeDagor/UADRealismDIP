# Base accuracy,,,,,,,,,,
Base,,,,,,,,,,The base accuracy by range.
Base,range 0.1km,,,Knife-Fighting Range,10000,,,,,EXAMPLE: Base uses sub-names for each 100m range incrament. Remove if you aren't going to use it.
Base,range 6km,,,$example_localization,,,,,,"EXAMPLE: If the range is a whole number, don't include the decimal. Ranges beyond 10km don't have decimals."
Out of Range,,,,,,,,,,Forces accuracy to 0 when all guns are out of range.
Range finding,,,,,,,,,,"Until first salvo is fired, has a constant -100% value. Not sure why this even exists."

# Variable Modifiers (Self/Ally),,,,,,,,,,
Flagship Communications,,,,,,,,,,Being close to the flagship improves coordination.
Far from Flagship,,,,,,,,,,Distance from flagship reduces shared accuracy and impairs communications.
Flooding Instability,,,,,,,,,,"Flooding will cause the ship to list at a variable rate, reducing accuracy."
Damage Instability,,,,,,,,,,Instability from being hit.
Gun Recoil,,,,,,,,,,Instability from our own guns firing.
Engine Vibrations,,,,,,,,,,Vibrations from the ship’s engines and machinery.
Guns of Different Barrels,,,,,,,,,,Number of gun calibers on our ship increases uncertainty when counting splashes.
Not Centerlined Guns,,,,,,,,,,"Wing guns complicate the firing solution, as each side has different positions and rotations compared to each other and the center line"
Various Funnel Emissions,,,,,,,,,,"Smoke from funnels, varies with speed/damage."
Thick Smoke from own Funnel,,,,,,,,,,Might be deprecated.
Own Guns' Splashes,,,,,,,,,,Splashes from our own guns degrade accuracy.
Other Guns' Splashes,,,,,,,,,,Splashes from other guns degrade accuracy.
Own Maneuver,,,,,,,,,,Acceleration/Deceleration from turning or changing speed will reduce the accuracy of our targeting.
Own Cruise Speed,,,,,,,,,,"Increasing the ship’s speed beyond a certain threshold will introduce vibrations and cavitation that reduce accuracy,"
Shooting through Smoke,,,,,,,,,,"When firing from within a smoke cloud, visual targeting is impaired."
Range Found,,,,,,,,,,Firing ranging shots will drastically improve accuracy. Can exceed +1000% when uncapped.
Conning Tower damaged,,,,,,,,,,Damage to conning tower interferes with the ship’s command structure.
Fire Control damaged,,,,,,,,,,Damage to the firing control system cripples the ship’s ability to track targets.

# Variable Modifiers (Enemy),,,,,,,,,,
Target Ship Size,,,,,,,,,,Larger targets are easier to hit.
Target's Maneuver,,,,,,,,,,Acceleration/Deceleration from the enemy turning or changing speed will reduce the accuracy of our targeting.
Target's Slow Speed,,,,,,,,,,Accuracy buff for slow moving targets.
Target's Fast Speed,,,,,,,,,,Accuracy buff for fast moving targets.
Target behind Smoke,,,,,,,,,,"When firing at a target hidden by a smoke cloud, visual targeting is impaired."
#,,,,,,,,,,
# Tech & Part (Constant) Modifiers,,,,,,,,,,
Technologies,,,,,,,,,,Various tech bonuses to accuracy.
Long-Range Techs & Tower,,,,,,,,,,Long range accuracy bonus from techs and tower parts.
Hull Stability & Tower,,,,,,,,,,Stability bonus from hull and tower parts.
1-barrels Turret Tech,,,,,,,,,,Tech for one-gun turrets.
2-barrels Turret Tech,,,,,,,,,,Tech for two-gun turrets.
3-barrels Turret Tech,,,,,,,,,,Tech for three-gun turrets.
4-barrels Turret Tech,,,,,,,,,,Tech for four-gun turrets.
Casemate Tech,,,,,,,,,,Tech for casemates.
