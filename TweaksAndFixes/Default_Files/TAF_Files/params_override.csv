# Predefined and Shared Designs Controls,,https://github.com/DukeDagor/UADRealismDIP/wiki/New-Params#predefined--shared-designs,,,,,,,
taf_force_no_predef_designs,0,"Forces ""Bespoke"" mode for campaign creation.",,,,,,,
taf_predef_ignore_missing,1,Ignore missing ships in predefined files. Useful for splitting predefs into multiple pieces.,,,,,,,
taf_predef_debug_enable,0,Campaigns will fail to load if the predefined ship list (from one or more predef files) has a nation-year pair with 0 designs. This will print what nations & years are missing and add extra constraints for low design count. This is printed into the log in CSV format.,,,,,,,
taf_predef_debug_format,1,1 = Plain text list | 1 = csv tables,,,,,,,
taf_predef_debug_min_ship_count,5,"The minimum number of designs per nation per year. This value is doubled for TBs and DDs. It is recommended to have at least 5, except for TBs and DDs which should have double that.",,,,,,,
taf_predef_debug_max_ship_count,1000,"The maximum number of designs per nation per year. Only use this amount for years when major tech changes occur. This value is doubled for TBs and DDs. It is recommended to have at most 15, except for TBs and DDs which can have double that.",,,,,,,

taf_shareddesign_bestTechValue,0.9,if at least one ship has greater than this tech commonality that set of ships will be randomly selected from as the shared design. Default 0.9,,,,,,,
taf_shareddesign_okTechValue,0.75,if there are no best ships any ships with greater tech commonality than this will be the next selection group. Default 0.75.,,,,,,,
taf_shareddesign_minTechValue,0.5,if no better ships are available any ships with greater tech commonality than this will be the final selection group. If no ships make even this level of commonality no shared design is returned. Default 0.5. ,,,,,,,
#,,Lastly when 1890 is the selected year in the shared design constructor only actual starting techs will be enabled for the ship rather than any tech with 1890 as its year. This prevents 1890 shared designs being actually unavailable to the AI on campaign start.,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,
# UI Changes,,,,,,,,,
taf_versiontext,0,Version text in the lower right corner of the screen will be replaced. Set to 0 for default version text. Set text in the str column (move 4 columns to the right).,,,,,,,
