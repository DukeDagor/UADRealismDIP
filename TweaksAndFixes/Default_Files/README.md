# Default Files:

These are all of the modable files for UAD, separated into new TAF files and base-game files. Note that not all base-game files are fully supported, or supported at all. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/DukeDagor/UADRealismDIP/wiki) for more information on these files.

# How to Use:

Copy the file(s) you want to modify into the Mods folder. It is recommended that you only copy over files you plan on moding, rather than copying all of the files.
